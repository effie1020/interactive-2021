<h1>This is the perspective from the entrance of the U.S. Consulate<br>October 1,2020 8:02 AM</h1>


<p style="color:#EEEEEE; width:580px" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#111111'" onMouseOut="this.style.color='#EEEEEE'">In the consulate, I saw a huge portrait of Pompeo, but not Trump. During that time, the Chinese government and Pompeo fought indiscriminately. Pompeo said that the Chinese Communist Party is a gangster, and that the Chinese Communist Party’s counterattack Pompeo on CCTV’s news broadcasts is the public enemy of mankind. I don't know what they are doing, I just want to go to school as soon as possible.</p>
