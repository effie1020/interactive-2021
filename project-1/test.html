<h1>Covid-19 test point in Phnom Penh, Cambodia<br>September 24,2020 9:41 AM</h1>


<p style="color:#EEEEEE; width:280px" onMouseOver="this.style.color='#111111'" onMouseOut="this.style.color='#EEEEEE'">This is a mandatory test. The cost is US$100. If you want to get back the US$2,000 deposit when you entered the country 14 days ago, you need to take your test report to the bank. However, it can only test 150 people every day. My companion and I came to line up at six in the morning for two consecutive days to complete the test.</p>
